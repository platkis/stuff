Hi, welcome to our assignment #3.

Our assignment 3 has the ability to create cubes, cyinders, cones, spheres, and teapots with the click of a button. You can also translate or rotate your most recently created object.

We were unable to make the ray intersection work however we believe we were close and you can have a look at our code to see for yourself. Enjoy :)

Controls:
'a' - add object

'j' - cube will be the next object added
'k' - cylinder will be the next object added
'i' - cone will be the next object added
'o' - sphere will be the next object added
'p' - teapot will be the next object added
